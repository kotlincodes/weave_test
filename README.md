### Coding Challenge Guidelines
Implement a simple app using Flutter and Native(iOS or Android). Create the project in Flutter
Add 2 tabs in the screen.
In the First tab. Add horizontal scroll view and then add the vertical scroll view its below.
- Horizontal scrollview should have the name of the states.
- Vertical scrollview should have the Indian state names and its Cities in a expanded list.
- Load the Indian states and cities using the json provided in states.json file.

When user select any state from the horizontal scroll list the vertical scrollview should also scroll to that state and expand the cities.

In the Second tab:
- Create a vertical list of Indian States and add swipe gesture feature(left and right both) in native Android/iOS UI.
- Host that native view in your Flutter app with platform view.
- Load the Indian states and cities using the json provided in states.json file.

 

Bonus features:
- Write test cases

Notes:
- Feel free to use dependency injection libraries such as Provider or get_it if appropriate.
- When building the UI and navigating between screens, choose the approach that makes most sense in terms of usability.
- Adding tests is not required for this project, but the final code should be testable.

If some requirements appear to be vague or lack sufficient details, make assumptions based on your own judgment.


### Evaluation Criteria
- The app works and satisfies the requirements outlined above
- General project structure and organization of code
- Separation of concerns between UI, authentication, database code
- Simplicity - we don't require an over-engineered solution
- Naming conventions for variables, functions and classes

Making the UI look nice is a bonus thing otherwise legible text and usable UI is sufficient.
